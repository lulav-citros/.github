# CITROS
CITROS was started as an inside product of [lulav space](https://lulav.space) to improve the verification and validation process for lunar navigation system development, but soon to be realized that this product can help many more companies or personal creating robotics.
As known, "with great software comes great responsibility",
We took on ourselves the mission to bring DevOps to the **robotic** community and by that increase the reliability of the robots and reducing the time to market.
